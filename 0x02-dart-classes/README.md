# **Introduction**

This project introduces Dart classes - the foundation of object-oriented programming. You’ll learn to create classes, use constructors, convert objects to JSON, implement private properties, and work with inheritance. Classes are important because they help organize code and model real-world objects in your programs.

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/1tXqmFt6OMZ1WsFmI1CL7Q "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google** :

### General

* Create basic classes with properties and methods.
* Use constructors to initialize class objects.
* Convert objects to/from JSON using toJson() and fromJson().
* Implement private properties using underscore prefix.
* Apply inheritance by extending one class from another
