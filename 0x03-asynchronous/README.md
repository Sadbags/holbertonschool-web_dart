## **Introduction**

This project teaches Dart asynchronous programming - essential for handling operations that take time like API calls, file reading, or database queries. You’ll learn to use async/await syntax, work with Future objects, handle errors properly, and make real HTTP requests to external APIs. Asynchronous programming prevents your app from freezing while waiting for slow operations to complete. The project uses the Rick and Morty API for practical examples, so you’ll be fetching interdimensional character data while understanding non-blocking code because even Rick would appreciate code that doesn’t freeze the multiverse!

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/iEcflt6bNvwO7eKoYJAU_A "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google** :

### General

* Use async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
* Work with Futures and understand delayed operations.
* Handle errors using try-catch blocks in async functions.
* Parse JSON data from API responses and async operations.
* Make HTTP requests to external APIs like Rick and Morty API

## Requirements

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `Dart 3.x.x`
* Use the Provided `util.dart` file(no need to push it)
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
