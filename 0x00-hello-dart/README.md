# **Introduction**

We are now starting our mobile development journey!

We are kicking off with this project, where you will get hands on with Dart, a modern programming language developed by  **Google** . Dart is fast, easy to learn, and perfect for building apps for mobile, web, and backend. You’ll explore its clean syntax, strong typing, and learn how it powers Flutter to create smooth, high-performance applications.

In this project, we will begin with the fundamentals, printing output, working with different data types, and exploring basic operations laying the foundation for more advanced Dart programming in the future.

# **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/ybXB3xSea-VIc-g6khjfUA "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google** :

### General

* Understand the basic structure and syntax of Dart.
* Learn how to declare and use variables with common data types (int, double, String).
* Practice printing output and interacting with simple console operations.
* Use control flow statements such as (if, else).
* Understand the role of the main() function as the entry point of a Dart program.

## Requirements

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `Dart 3.x.x`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
